	abstract = {Early and accurate melanoma detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence ({AI}) have shown promise in this area, but the technology’s effectiveness across diverse skin tones remains a critical challenge. This study conducts a systematic review and preliminary analysis of {AI}-based melanoma detection research published between 2013 and 2024, focusing on deep learning methodologies, datasets, and skin tone representation. Our findings indicate that while {AI} can enhance melanoma detection, there is a significant bias towards lighter skin tones. To address this, we propose including skin hue in addition to skin tone as represented by the L’Oreal Color Chart Map for a more comprehensive skin tone assessment technique. This research highlights the need for diverse datasets and robust evaluation metrics to develop {AI} models that are equitable and effective for all patients. By adopting best practices outlined in a {PRISMA}-Equity framework tailored for healthcare and melanoma detection, we can work towards reducing disparities in melanoma outcomes.},
