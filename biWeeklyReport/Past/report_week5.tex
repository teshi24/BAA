		\hline
		\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Details} \\
		\hline
		Progress Overview (inkl. Reasons for Deviations of the Plan) &
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[\ongoing] Getting familiar with PASSION dataset
			\begin{itemize}
				\item still awaiting answers from Philippe (reminder sent)
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\ongoing] Literature review (biases, fairness and mitigation)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item there are many different biases out there
				\item got an overview in table form, texts still outstanding
				\item fairness metrics and mitigation methods in dermatology could be more detailed 
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\ongoing] Categorize already found biases, fairness metrics and mitigation methods - Scope BAA, Scope Outlook, Out Of Scope
			\begin{itemize}
				\item lots of information to compile (not trusting ChatGPT to do it)
				\item working to much instead of focusing on BAA
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\notstarted] Crafting methodology for thesis
			\begin{itemize}
				\item I am stuck in an information overflow and unsure on how to proceed between categorization and crafting the methodology
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Accomplishments & \begin{itemize}
			\item[\done] Collected an extensive list of biases, sensitive features, fairness definitions and mitigation methods
			\item[\done] Split mitigation methods between scopes (PASSION, Others)
			\item[\done] Found interesting and relevant insights e.g. FST scale critique (2025)
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Risks and Measures & 
		Missing Balance BAA - Work - Life, mainly due to chaos at work
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Set clear boundaries at work (work hours, prioritization, delegation)
			\item Shift focus from work to BAA
			\item Plan clear off time for regeneration
		\end{itemize}
		
		Struggling to filter the most relevant information
		\begin{itemize}
			\item categorize insights into scopes BAA (ML, Dermatology), Outlook, Out Of Scope
		\end{itemize}
		
		Deciding on wrong biases or fairness metrics to focus on.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Narrow down the options, justifying the choices
			\item Validate with Ludovic
		\end{itemize}
		
		%Procrastination
		%\begin{itemize}
		%	\item Need to allocate specific time slots when working on the thesis
		%	\item Accountability partners also on Wednesday afternoon and one day on the weekend
		%\end{itemize}
		 \\
		
		\hline
		Next Steps & \begin{itemize}
			\item Follow up Philippe
			\item Finalize categorization of already found biases, fairness metrics and mitigation methods in the already defined scopes
			\item Craft methodology to use during this thesis
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Discussion Points / Questions & \begin{itemize}
			\item Best way to follow up Philippe
			\item Dates for mid-term presentation, my suggestion:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 7.4. trial presentation with AI Research Lab
				\item 8.4. - 15.4. mid-term presentation
			\end{itemize} 
			\item Can't access those papers, both related to ethic / bias in AI for dermatology
			\begin{itemize}
				\item https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2688587
				\item  https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/190/6/789/7603706?redirectedFrom=fullte

		Additional Notes & - \\

		Attachments  & \begin{itemize}

		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Protocol  & 
		Coordination / Infos
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Nadja writes another mail to Philippe with Ludovic in CC
			\item Ludovic coordinates the dates for the presentations
			\item Ludovic will send the 2 outstanding papers
		\end{itemize}
		
		Work Load Management
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "Treat your future self as a friend" -> think about that when planning / committing to work
			\item Boundaries and focus shift important - limited time for BAA which persists later vs. time at work can be extended
		\end{itemize}
		
		Relevance for the Thesis
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Representation Learning methods are relevant, since this is used for feature extraction; mitigation methods therefore in scope
			\item FST scale is good to mention, but it cannot be changed during the thesis --> add as proposal (mention practicability, Color Chart Map would need to be done automatically)
			\item While categorizing, keep in mind that certain methods are not possible anyway for the BAA period (e.g. sudden re-labelling); this will narrow the amount of possible methodologies further
		\end{itemize}
		
		Data Display
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Categorize further, mention only categories in tables and examples in text
		\item Merge Dermatology and Demography in Dermatology columns
		
		\end{itemize}
		
		Citations
		\begin{itemize}
		\item For subsequent sentences from the same source - only add the citation on the last sentence 
		\item For categories, cite survey, for examples original source
		\end{itemize} \\
