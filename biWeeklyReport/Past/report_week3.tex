		\hline
		\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Details} \\
		\hline
		Progress Overview (inkl. Reasons for Deviations of the Plan) &
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[\done] Adapted timetable based on feedback and initial progress
			\item[\done] Integrated new HSLU LaTex template
			\item[\ongoing] Finalized problem statement (assignment described)
			\item[\ongoing] Getting familiar with PASSION dataset
			\begin{itemize}
				\item awaiting answers from Philippe
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\ongoing] Literature review (biases, fairness and mitigation)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[\ongoing] generally in ML
				\begin{itemize}
					\item found a survey with a broad list of biases and fairness metrics
				\end{itemize}
				\item[\ongoing] generally related to demographics
				\begin{itemize}
					\item lacking a general overview, most sources focus on AI and face recognition
					\item research lead to sources with insights in demographic biases in dermatology
				\end{itemize}
				\item[\notstarted] generally related to dermatology biases
				\begin{itemize}
					\item ML survey took more time to read than expected
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Accomplishments & \begin{itemize}
			\item[\done] Documented overview of the PASSION dataset
			\item[\done] Literature review became engaging
			\item[\done] First methodology ideas formed
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Risks and Measures & 
		Struggling to filter the most relevant information
		\begin{itemize}
			\item before diving into a paper, revisit the goal of the review
 			\item categorize insights into Scope BAA, Scope Outlook, Out Of Scope
		\end{itemize}
		
	    Difficulty identifying key demographic bias factors (most research focuses on gender and skin type, leading to gaps)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Resort to statistic biases
			\item Research specific ideas instead (such as relevant risk factors in dermatology)
		\end{itemize}
		
		Deciding on wrong biases or fairness metrics to focus on.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Narrow down the options, justifying the choices
			\item Validate with Ludovic
		\end{itemize}
		
		%Procrastination
		%\begin{itemize}
		%	\item Need to allocate specific time slots when working on the thesis
		%	\item Accountability partners also on Wednesday afternoon and one day on the weekend
		%\end{itemize}
		\\
		\hline
		Next Steps & \begin{itemize}
			\item Continue literature review
			\item Categorize already found biases, fairness metrics and mitigation methods - Scope BAA, Scope Outlook, Out Of Scope
			\item Craft methodology to use during this thesis
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Discussion Points / Questions & \begin{itemize}
			\item When citing meta-studies, should I reference the original studies instead?
			\item Should I document out-of-scope but seemingly relevant findings? To what extent?
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Additional Notes & The hints regarding how to literature review were very helpful advise\\
		\hline
		Attachments  & - \\
		\hline
		Protocol  & 
		Methodology
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Presented ideas are just very first ideas, need for sure to do more research on mitigation methods
			\item Mitigation for 3rd risk is ok
		\end{itemize}
		
		PASSION dataset
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Send reminder to Philippe, if he doesn't respond, Ludovic could ask some questions during the meeting on Friday, 14.3.25
			\item PASSION didn't use the labels during training, or would've stated in in the paper otherwise (double check it)
		\end{itemize}
		
		Demographic biases
		\begin{itemize}
			\item for training only relevant when the diseases present themselves differently in patients, e.g. depending on gender / age. Otherwise they are 'just' a risk factor for the patients and not directly relevant for the PASSION dataset (e.g. profession)
			\item focus on them in context of dermatology instead
			\item if some topics are later still relevant, research specific questions then
		\end{itemize}
		
		Writing and Citations
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Write in iterations, first what comes to mind and improve it later
			\item Reference original study, unless info was derived in the meta study
			\item Document out of scope but seemingly relevant findings. Focus on mentioning them, what differentiate them from the others and stating why they are not pursued in more detail. Work with families
			\begin{itemize}
				\item write something and show Ludovic
			\end{itemize}
			\item Scoping for the first risk makes sense, define criteria for the categories more tangible, divide BAA further in regards of ML and dermatology
			
		\end{itemize} \\
