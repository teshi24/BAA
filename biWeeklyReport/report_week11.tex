		\hline
		\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Details} \\
		\hline
		Progress Overview (inkl. Reasons for Deviations of the Plan) & \begin{itemize}[topsep=6pt]
			\item[\done] Reproducing PASSION results
			\item[\done] Get pipeline to calculate the required values to compute the fairness metrics
			\item[\ongoing] Reproducing PASSION results with the new pipeline
			\begin{itemize}
				\item results on group level are not reproducible anymore: either I used wrong checkpoint, messed up the training code OR the initial calculations on group level did not take into account the correct labels
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\ongoing] Deciding which mitigation methods to evaluate
			\begin{itemize}
				\item PASSION already uses lots of the suggested mitigation methods
				\item Code bases of aif360 and fairlearn are require adaptions of the datasets on runtime which are not straightforward to me
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\notstarted] writing report
			\begin{itemize}
				\item was important to get some results
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Accomplishments & \begin{itemize}[topsep=6pt]
			\item[\done] PASSION results reproduced
			\item[\done] Fairness metrics calculable
			\item[\done] Runtime issues successfully mitigated
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Risks and Measures &
		
		Loss of trust in experimental integrity
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rerunning the adapted code with initial PASSION configuration and compare result again to the PASSION paper
			\item Carefully testing the evaluation by hand
			\item When issues persist: get a code review 
		\end{itemize}
		 
		Delays in evaluation of mitigation methods due to unclear integration steps of aif306 / fairlearn
		\begin{itemize}
			\item check if the AAI-Team has worked with any of the libs
			\item focus on other mitigation methods
		\end{itemize}
		
	    Reduced impact / novelty of the analysis due to already implemented mitigation strategies
		\begin{itemize}
			\item potentially using post-processing methods as they are not yet used in passion
			\item use data augmentation / preferential sampling as simulation of different sampling processes
			\item include center evaluation in the bias analysis and try to apply mitigation methods for img quality issues
		\end{itemize}
		
		Neglecting the report, resulting in pressure at the end of the thesis
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Set clear timeframes for ONLY writing on the report
		\end{itemize}\\
		
		\hline
		Next Steps & \begin{itemize}[topsep=6pt]
			\item Resolve reproducibility issues
			\item Introduce first mitigation metric
			\item Write report
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Discussion Points / Questions & \begin{itemize}[topsep=6pt]
			\item most feasible approach for the mitigation methods
		\end{itemize} \\
