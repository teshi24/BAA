		\hline
		\textbf{Section} & \textbf{Details} \\
		\hline
		Progress Overview (inkl. Reasons for Deviations of the Plan) & \begin{itemize}
			\item[\textcolor{green}{\ding{52}}] KickOff and Assignment Upload
			\item[\textcolor{orange}{\ding{45}}] Request Access to PASSION dataset
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Access granted but Switch Drive was down when I wanted to test the access
			\end{itemize}
			\item[\textcolor{green}{\ding{52}}] Prepare timetable
			\item[\textcolor{orange}{\ding{45}}] Setup LaTex Base Document
			\item[\textcolor{red}{\ding{56}}] Start Literature Review on general ML biases
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Started writing Problem Statement which helped getting into LaTex, which took some time away from the Review
				\item Setting up LaTex templates took longer than expected
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Accomplishments & \begin{itemize}
			\item[\textcolor{green}{\ding{52}}] Setup of the most important documents / templates
			\item[\textcolor{green}{\ding{52}}] Report already started
			\item[\textcolor{green}{\ding{52}}] Tasks for first phase are clear
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Risks and Measures & 
		Wasting Time on Irrelevant/Poor-Quality Sources
		\begin{itemize}
			\item prioritizing papers with high citation counts
			\item using systematic strategy as proposed by Ludovic
		\end{itemize}
		
	    Missed Citations/Wasted Time Later to Re-Find Papers
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Writing a summary for each paper directly in the corresponding bib file that includes: key concept, research question, findings and potential section of the thesis where it could be used.
			\item Adding citations immediately while writing in the final report.
		\end{itemize}
		
		Focus Too Much on One Research Topic, Neglecting Others
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Applying time-boxing: Set time limits for each topic and stick to it.
		\end{itemize} \\
		
		\hline
		Next Steps & \begin{itemize}
			\item Test the Access to PASSION dataset
			\item Finalize Problem Statement (or should this be done later in the process?)
			\item Literature Review according to plan
			\item Fix LaTex Template
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Discussion Points / Questions & \begin{itemize}
			\item Timetable, especially the allocated time for the individual research topics
			\item How can I fix that the Glossary and Figures List appear as chapters in LaTeX?
			\item Feedback regarding this first report
		\end{itemize} \\
		\hline
		Additional Notes & I will be out next Monday due to Lucerne Carneval. I will work instead more during the rest of the week from remote. \\
		\hline
		Attachments  & \begin{itemize}
			\item Timetable
			\item GitHub Repo: \href{https://github.com/teshi24/BAA}{https://github.com/teshi24/BAA}
